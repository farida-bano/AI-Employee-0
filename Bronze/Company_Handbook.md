# Company Handbook

## Rules

- Always log important actions in `System_log.md`.
- Never take destructive action (e.g., deleting files) without explicit confirmation.
- When a task is completed, move its corresponding file from `Needs_Action` to the `Done` folder.
- Keep task files in `Needs_Action` and `Done` clearly named and structured.
- If any instruction is unclear or ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.
